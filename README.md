# Rudra Mishra's Portfolio Website

This is my personal animated portfolio website built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a vertical scroll layout with video backgrounds and section-based smooth animations. The site has four main parts:

1. **Intro** â€“ My profile and introduction.
2. **Projects** â€“ Showcasing CyberPAD, CyberOS, and this website itself.
3. **Socials** â€“ Links to my Instagram, GitHub, and Slack.
4. **HackClub** â€“ A section about Hack Club and its projects.

It uses smooth scroll, section transitions, and a minimal vertical sidebar for navigation. Each section fades in on scroll, making the experience more dynamic.

This is a **static site**, meaning it doesnâ€™t use any backend or server-side code. Itâ€™s hosted for free using **GitHub Pages**, which makes it easily accessible with just a link.
